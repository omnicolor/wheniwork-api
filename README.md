When I Work API Documentation
========

This is the source for the API documentation of [When I Work](https://www.wheniwork.com). If you're looking for the actual documentation page, it can be found at [http://dev.wheniwork.com](http://dev.wheniwork.com).

Editing the Documentation
------------------------------

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Ruby, version 1.9.3 or newer**
 - **Bundler** â€” If Ruby is already installed, but the `bundle` command doesn't work, just run `gem install bundler` in a terminal.


### Getting Set Up

 1. Fork this repository on Github.
 2. Clone *your forked repository* to your hard drive with `git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/wheniwork-api.git`
 3. `cd wheniwork-api`
 4. Install all dependencies: `bundle install`
 5. Start the test server: `bundle exec middleman server`

You can now see the docs at <http://localhost:4567>. And as you edit `source/index.md`, your server should automatically update! Whoa! That was fast!

### Editing

Now that the API docs are all set up your machine, you'll probably want to learn more about [editing Slate markdown](https://github.com/tripit/slate/wiki/Markdown-Syntax). We do a few things differently from Slate, though, so look through this section before start editing.

#### Asides

Rather than using raw HTML tags, we use the `aside` method. This lets us use Markdown in asides! You can set the type of aside by setting the optional parameter `:class` to either `'notice'` or `'warning'`.

```erb
<% aside do %>
  This is a typical notice.
<% end %>

<% aside :class => 'warning' do %>
  This is a warning!
<% end %>
```

### Deploying

To deploy the API docs, run 'rake publish' from the root directory of the repository. You'll need to have proper permissions in order to perform this task.
